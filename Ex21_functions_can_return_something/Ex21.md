# Functions Can Return Something

You have been using the = character to name variables and set them to numbers or strings. We’re
now going to blow your mind again by showing you how to use = and a new Python word, return,
to set variables to be a value from a function.

We are now doing our own math functions for add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The important
thing to notice is the last line where we say return a + b (in add). What this does is the following:

1.  Our function is called with two arguments: a and b.
2. We print out what our function is doing, in this case “ADDING.”
3. We tell Python to do something kind of backward: we return the addition of a + b. You might
say this as, “I add a and b, then return them.”
4. Python adds the two numbers. Then when the function ends, any line that runs it will be able
to assign this a + b result to a variable.
