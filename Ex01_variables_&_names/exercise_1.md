# Variables and Names
Now you can print things with print and you can do math. The next step is to learn about variables.
In programming, a variable is nothing more than a name for something, similar to how my name,
“Zed,” is a name for “the human who wrote this book.” Programmers use these variable names to make
their code read more like English and because they have lousy memories. If they didn’t use good names
for things in their software, they’d get lost when they tried to read their code again.
If you get stuck with this exercise, remember the tricks you have been taught so far of finding differences
and focusing on details:
1. Write a comment above each line explaining to yourself in English what it does.
2. Read your .py file backward.
3. Read your .py file out loud, saying even the characters.
