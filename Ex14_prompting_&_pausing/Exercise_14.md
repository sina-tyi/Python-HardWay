# Prompting and Passing

Let’s do one exercise that uses argv and input together to ask the user something specific. You
will need this for the next exercise where you learn to read and write files. In this exercise we’ll
use input slightly differently by having it print a simple > prompt. This is similar to games like Zork or
Adventure.
