# Strings, Bytes, and Character Encodings

To do this exercise you’ll need to download a text file that I’ve written named languages.txt (https://
learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/languages.txt). This file was created with a list of human languages
to demonstrate a few interesting concepts:

1. How modern computers store human languages for display and processing and how Python
3 calls this strings
2. How you must “encode” and “decode” Python’s strings into a type called bytes.
3. How to handle errors in your string and byte handling.
4. How to read code and find out what it means even if you’ve never seen it before.

In addition to that you’ll also get a brief glimpse of the Python 3 if-statement and lists for processing
a list of things. You don’t have to master this code or understand these concepts right away. You’ll
get plenty of practice in later exercises. For now your job is to get a taste of the future and learn the four
topics in the preceding list.
