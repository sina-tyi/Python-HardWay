What we want to do now is get data into your programs.
This is a little tricky because you have to learn to do two things that may not make sense right
away, but trust me and do it anyway. It will make sense in a few exercises.
Most of what software does is the following:
1. Takes some kind of input from a person.
2. Changes it.
3. Prints out something to show how it changed.
So far you have been printing strings, but you haven’t been able to get any input from a person. You may
not even know what “input” means, but type this code in anyway and make it exactly the same. In the
next exercise we’ll do more to explain input.
